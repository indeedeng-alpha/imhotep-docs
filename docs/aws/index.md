## Introduction

Before getting started, familiarize yourself with the [Imhotep architecture](../architecture-overview/).

These instructions require an AWS account and explain how to set up your S3 storage and three EC2 instance types:

1. Zookeeper
1. ImhotepDaemon
1. Imhotep Frontend

These instructions are based on the configuration that can be easily deployed using the AWS CloudFormation scripts described in the [Quick Start](http://opensource.indeedeng.io/imhotep/docs/quick-start/) guide.

For fault tolerance, you should run replicated Zookeeper instances in a quorum. See the [Zookeeper instructions](http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/cdh/5/zookeeper/zookeeperStarted.html) for more information.

For scalability, you may want to adapt these instructions to create an auto scaling group to run multiple ImhotepDaemon instances as needed.

## Instructions

1. [Set up S3 storage](s3-storage/)
1. [Set up SSH access and security groups](security/)
1. [Set up Zookeeper](zookeeper/)
1. [Set up ImhotepDaemon](imhotep-daemon/)
1. [Set up ImhotepFrontend](imhotep-frontend/)

Once you've completed all these steps, you will have a working Imhotep cluster with web frontend endpoints /iql and /iupload.
